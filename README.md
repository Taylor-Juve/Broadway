"Learn CSS: Display and Positioning." Given HTML and CSS, I added CSS by following given steps. Check Commit diff for my changes. 

I carefully read each step one sentence at a time and worked as soon as I could determine the task. E.g. "Now, fix up the supporting element style below the image.", I checked the webpage and saw overlapping and wrote my fix then checked the remaining sentences of the step to double check my work. I also tried to guess the next step before reading it's first sentence. 

I did the extra work and used "bottom" property for the first time. They didn't ask but I also added margin to some elements for better appeal.
